This project is part of the [code institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) course. 

It is a walkthrough project and the code is followed in the course to make the website. The objective is to learn and deepen the knowledge of HTML and CSS by completing a project.

## Please note that the code to build the website is not written by me but has been well understood.
